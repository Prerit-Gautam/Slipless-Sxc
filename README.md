<br>
A cross platform app made with Flutter to digitize the Slip based process of St. Xavier's College Kathmandu
<br>

Currently, students leaving the college on a half-leave basis need to obtain the approval of the
Coordinator/Director and carry a small yellow slip for verification at the gate. However, this
manual process is prone to inefficiencies such as slips being easily lost or misplaced. Moreover,
it requires manual entry into the college database, adding to administrative workload and
increasing the chance of errors.
<br>
This project aims to digitize and streamline the leave management process by developing a
mobile and web-based platform where student leave details can be filled out at the office
digitally, approval can be obtained digitally and leave can be verified by the guards at the gate.
Additionally All leave-related data is securely stored and accessible in a centralized database.
This solution will eliminate the need for physical slips, enhance reliability, and simplify
record-keeping for both students and administrative staff.
